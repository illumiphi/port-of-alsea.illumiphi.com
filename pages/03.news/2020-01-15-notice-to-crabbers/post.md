- effective Jan 1, 2020

===

Crabbers are reminded that effective Jan. 1, 2020, all surface buoys used with recreational crab pots or rings must be marked to identify the owner of the gear.

The identifying information should include first and last name or business name and at least one of the following: permanent address, phone number, ODFW ID number, or vessel identification number. Be sure the identifying information is visible, legible and permanent. This new rule does not apply to crabbing gear used from piers, jetties or beaches.

Tags are not an acceptable substitute for marking buoys.

While other aspects of crab gear are not required by rule, ODFW strongly encourages the use of sinking line, durable buoys, escape rings, and destruct mechanisms like untreated cotton line.

The Port of Alsea does not do enforcement of regulations, but we do try to keep people up to date on new regulations.
