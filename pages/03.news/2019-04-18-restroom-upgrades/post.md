First Bond Measure Project completed thanks to our Port of Alsea District voters!          

===

The bond measure approved by voters in 2018 provided for upgrades to the Port’s public restrooms.  

In March, a request for bids resulted in a contractor being selected and work began at the end of the month.  The project was completed in April 2019, and what an improvement!  

The entire building was pressure washed, new, non-skid flooring was applied, and walls were given a new coat of paint. 

A new, metal roof, rain gutters and skylights were added.

In both the men’s and women’s restrooms, new green stall walls and doors went up, new and more efficient plumbing and new lighting fixtures were installed.

The entire facility is now much more welcoming and efficient for our visitors and should serve our Port well in the years to come.
