Established by Oregon Legislative Action in 1910, the 21st-Century Port of Alsea manages the Alsea and Yachats waterways, which are almost untouched by commercial activity. As a result, the Alsea and Yachats river systems’ highly elevated ecological, biological and scenic qualities set the Oregon Coast standard for the picturesque, the unspoiled, the recreationally accessible.

The Port of Alsea has two primary focii:

- Stewardship and preservation of the invaluable community asset that is the pristine ecological and aesthetic condition of waterways within the Port District.

- Emphasizing the augmentation of recreational activity, full development of the 
business potential of the Port of Alsea’s real-property assets.

The Port of Alsea’s governing authority derives from [ORS 777](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors777.html), while the Port’s rules of compliance are delineated in [ORS 192](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors192.html).

A five-member elected, but unpaid Board of Commissioners guides the Port’s decision-making and daily operations. Throughout the year, day-to-day administration of the Port of Alsea is the responsibility of the Port’s single and part time Manager –  responding directly to the Board of Commissioners. 

Operational expenses of the Port are entirely paid for from the following list of revenue sources: boat ramp and moorage fees, leases on real properties owned by the Port, property taxes paid by the owners of real property within the Port District, and occasional Grants skillfully garnered by the Port Manager, as well as donations.

The physical boundaries of the Port District are: north - Marsh Street just south of Seal Beach,  south - the Lincoln/Lane County Line, east - the Benton County Line.
