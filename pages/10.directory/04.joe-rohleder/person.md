Commissioner since 2012

===

Joe was appointed to the Alsea Port Commission two years ago and elected for a four year term in November of 2015. Joe and his wife of thirty-seven years, Jannette Macpherson, live on Eckman Creek Road. Joe represents commercial fisheries and sport anglers and hunters at the Oregon Legislature. Joeâ€™s goal on the Commission is for the Port of Alsea to remain both economically and environmentally sustainable. In his spare time, he maintains a large rhodendron garden and a small wooden dory and is out on the local rivers fishing.
