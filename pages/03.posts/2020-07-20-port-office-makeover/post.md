Thank you to Port of Alsea commissioners Rob Bishop, Buster Pankey, and Joe Rohleder for repainting the Port of Alsea office building tday. Thanks to Nick Rust for helping.  And a big thank you to Maddie, Rob's granddaughter who pitched in all day, painting primer and a lot of the  the front railings.  We will finish the railings tomorrow.  The railings need some work.  The posts especially have dry rot at the bases.  But that is for another day, maybe even another year.  Thanks to all of you for your help!
