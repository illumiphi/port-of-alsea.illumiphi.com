Boaters at the Port of Alsea received a one-week reprieve on the boat launch shutting down. Instead of shutting down Wednesday, October 21 at 5:00 pm, we are now scheduled to close the boat launch on Thursday, October 29. The high tides are wrong to start excavating the top of the ramp before the in-water-season starts November 1.
