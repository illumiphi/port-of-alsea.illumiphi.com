Thank you to all of you who wrote letters of support for the two grant applications submitted by the Port of Alsea to the Oregon State Marine Board to help fund the new kayak launch and to finish paving the rest of the boat launch parking lot.  OSMB approved both of the grants this morning and the kayak launch and paving project will be part of the Port's boat launch and marina construction project this winter.
