Recreational crabbers can still crab off both sides of A Dock that is open and on both sides of the transition dock between A Dock and B Dock.  However, there will no longer be crabbing off B-8 through B-10.  We need those slips now for boats.  Dock crabbers can also crab off the smaller, newer docks down the gangway from the ADA platform.
