The boat launch at the Port of Alsea will be closed on Tuesday morning, June 12, for maintenance and will be closed intermittently on Wednesday and Thursday as well.

===


I will post every day when it is closed and when it will reopen again. When the launch is open on Tuesday through Thursday, you will need to launch without the use of the floating docks. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we need to make repairs to keep the floating dock serviceable until they can be replaced in the winter of 2019 / 2020 with the proceeds from the bond measure.

The Port of Alsea Facebook page will be updated as to openings or closures as they occur throughout the project.
