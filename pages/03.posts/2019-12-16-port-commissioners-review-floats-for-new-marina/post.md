Astoria

===

A picture of two of the Port of Alsea commissioners looking at the floats being fabricated in Astoria for the Port's new docks. The commissioners were enthused by what they saw. Bergerson Construction has not yet purchased the side bumpers for the floats, so Bergerson is going to provide samples and prices so the Board of Commissioners can make a selection from their choices at a regular board meeting soon.
