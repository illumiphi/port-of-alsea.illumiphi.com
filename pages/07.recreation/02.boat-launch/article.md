===


> **Alsea Bay has no maintained channel or jetties to provide safe navigation to or from the ocean.**  Dangerous conditions exist at the mouth of the Alsea on ebb tides.  Because of new siltation around and in the marina, please avoid using the boat launch on negative tides.

- **Daily launch permits** are $7.00.
- **Annual launch permits** are available for $50.00
- **Boat trailer parking** is free with launch.
- **Short term moorage**:  Moorage is $10/night.  Discounts are available for longer stays and range from $60 per week to $1,000 for annual moorage.  Moorage is available year round, but winter weather requires that boat owners check their vessel daily.  Water and power are not provided on the moorage floats.
