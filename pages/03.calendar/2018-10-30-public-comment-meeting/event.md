The Port of Alsea is also seeking input now from the port facility users on what they would like to see in the new marina design.

===

Ginger Gou has been meeting with kayakers, Kris Kodrack is putting together some moorage holders, and each of those groups will be meeting here at the Port office to give us input. We don't really have that with the recreational crabbing dock users, so I am just going to pick a date. I and possibly one or two commissioners will be here at the Port office on Tuesday, October 30, at 5:30. Anyone who uses the crabbing platform or crabbing dock is welcome to stop by and provide input to us on meeting your needs with the marina design.
