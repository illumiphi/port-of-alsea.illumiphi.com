# I.  East Parking Lot
The east parking lot was in really bad condition, with significant pot holes.  I had Mark Wiederhold grade out the parking lot where the pot holes are and bring in new rock.  The cost was $800.

# II.  Shop Area
Nick Rust has done a great job of cleaning out the shop area and making repairs.  The area behind the shop is now completely cleaned out, the shop itself is cleaned out, and Nick has also made repairs to the inside gutter inside the shop that used to leak unto the equipment below.  He replaced the acrylic panels up near the roof, which has made the shop much more light inside.  He is also working hard to get the exterior ready for the summer, such as power washing the boat ramp and designing new reserved signs for the marina.

# III. Utilities / LED Bulbs
I reported last month that I had requested that Central Lincoln replace the exterior lights in the parking lots and marina with LED lights to save us money.  They responded that they would replace the existing bulbs with LEDs as they burnt out, although they also said that they may keep installing the incandescent bulbs as replacements until they run out.  I am looking for ways to reduce our utility bills because they consume about 14% of our annual revenue.

# IV. Parking Lot Striping
I have ordered paint and Nick will start repainting the curbs and parking lot striping when the weather permits. Because we will be adding four more truck / boat trailer spaces behind the office, I am going to add another reserved space for Fire and Rescue next to the one they have now, and put another one on the curb up by the fish cleaning station, where we currently do not allow parking.  With three parking spaces reserved for them, they should not need to park their vehicles at the top of the launch area.  My goal is to reduce the congestion at the launch that has occurred in the past when they have responded to calls.
We are also going to add parking space striping in the east parking lot to make the use of the lot as efficient as possible.  Since we cannot add more land presently to provide more parking, I will try to maximize the amount of parking we can realize from the land we do have.
