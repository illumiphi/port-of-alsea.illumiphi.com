Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  View the Future members Joanne Kittel, Judy Richter, Shelly Shrock, Sherry Dickinson, and Andrea Scharf attended.  Report Dennis Astine from the Newport News-Times attended.

# II. APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the February 15, 2018 minutes and February, 2018 Financial Report.  Pankey seconded the motion.  The motion passed 5-0.

# III. MANAGER’S REPORT

The written Manager’s Report are incorporated into the minutes.

# IV. PUBLIC COMMENT

There was no public comment.

# V. VIEW THE FUTURE PRESENTATION

The members present from View the Future (VTF) introduced themselves.  Chair Joanne Kittel explained that VTF has been in existence for 14 years.  It was started by Andrea Scharf, who also served as chair for 12 years.  The organizations goals are centered around science, recreation, and preservation of land and culture. Preservation of land is focused on conservation easements in perpetuity.  It currently has three properties.

It is currently trying to acquire approximately 32 acres on the Yachats River.  The undeveloped 29 acres on the south side of the river is zoned R-1 and inside the Yachats city limits.  The three acres north of the river are outside the city limits.  View the Future feels this would be excellent acreage for a park with a kayak / canoe launch.  Trust for Public Land is interested in the project.  The Watershed Council is interested in possibly providing funding as well, but has more restrictions on use.  VFT is preparing a grant to submit with the City of Yachats to the Oregon State Parks for $1,000,000; Yachats would provide a $200,000 match.  VTF would like to acquire the property because it feels that a housing development would have serious impacts on the Yachats River.  The City may build a sedimentation pond to store water during low use for high use times and areas.  The City of Yachats is behind the project 100%.

VTF was asked if there were any mitigation projects along the Yachats River that the Port could possibly use in the event the bond measure passes and the new boat launch is constructed.  The members of VTF explained there are invasive grasses, such as knotweed, in the river that need to be removed.  However, it is very difficult to do so because it must be removed by hand from the water.  Pieces that break off are carried by the water to new locations, where they become established.

The commissioners expresses a willingness to build a kayak / canoe launch on the river if a group such as VTF were to acquire access land along the river.

# VI.	OLD BUSINESS

## A.  	Port’s Bond Measure Information Mailing

Cuellar told the commissioners that the Elections Division at the Secretary of State’s office had approved the wording of the information sheet that the Port would be mailing out to households with registered voters.  She also told the commissioners that the number of households was higher than she had estimated, so the cost of the mailer would be a few hundred dollars more than anticipated.  The mailer is scheduled to reach voters’ mailboxes about April 21.  Ballots will be mailed out on about April 25.

## B. 	Use of Lot Behind the Office

Cuellar told the commissioners that Mark Wiederhold would be leveling the lot behind the office for the food carts.  Troy Smith wants to install his food cart in May and open as soon as possible.  The Port would work with any food carts and Wiederhold to determine where to install the utilities.  The Port will provide water, power, and sewer.


# V1II.	NEW BUSINESS

## A.   	Reappointment of Linda Eriksen to the Budget Committee

Power moved to reappoint Linda Eriksen to the Budget Committee.  Pankey seconded.  The motion was approved 5-0.

## B.   	Budget Process

Cuellar reminded the commissioners that the budget process was about to begin again.  One issue this year was when to hold the Budget Committee meeting because of the bond measure on the May 15 ballot.  Normally, the Port holds its Budget Committee meeting the second Thursday of May, which would be before the election.  The actual budget adopted by the Board after the budget hearing would depend upon whether the bond measure passes or not.  Cuellar told the commissioners that if the Port waited to hold its Budget Committee meeting until after May 15, it would push the Board’s meeting into early June.  The options were to hold the Budget Committee meeting as usual on the second Thursday of May, and make any needed adjustments to the proposed budget after the election but before the budget hearing notices are published or to hold the budget meeting after May 15 when the election results will be known.  The commissioners preferred the first option which would allow the May Board meeting / budget hearing to be held before the end of May.

## C.    	Approval of Memorial Bench Application

The commissioners reviewed an application from Eleanor (Ellie) Donovan to install a memorial bench at the Port memorializing her husband, B. J. Donovan.  The commissioners approved the request, stipulating that the bench be made with stainless steel fasteners to resist rust.

# IX.	COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

There were no comments from the commissioners.

# X. 	ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:00.
