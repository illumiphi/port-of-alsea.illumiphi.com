===

The role of the Citizensâ€™ Review Committee will be to meet no more than three times a year to review the financial documents pertaining to expenditures of the proceeds from the bond measure passed by voters of the Port District in May, 2018.

Specifically, the committee will review invoices, bank statements (including cancelled checks), and QuickBook reconciliations to insure that the proceeds from the bond measure have been properly spent as permitted under the bond measure itself or state law.  The Port Manager will serve as the staff person for the committee.  All applicants, whether they supported or opposed the bond measure, are invited to submit an application to serve on the committee.

Please explain why you would like to serve on the committee and what strengths you would bring to the committee.
