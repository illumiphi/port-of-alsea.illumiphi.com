The Alsea is one of the most pristine estuaries on the Oregon Coast, and offers excellent opportunities for recreation. The Port of Alsea provides easy access to your bay and river adventures. Catch your own Dungeness crab and fish the fall run of Chinook salmon. Take a relaxing walk along a quiet beach and enjoy the small town flavor of Waldport and Yachats. Follow the tide up the Alsea River to forested campgrounds and sunny swimming holes.  Put in your kayak and canoes to explore the Alsea and Yachats Rivers.

The Port office is located at 365 Port Street, on the waterfront in Waldport, Oregon.  The Portâ€™s public facilities include a launch ramp, boat moorage, and a picnic area. An accessible viewing platform give visitors a close up look at marine life while crabbing. Crab rings, bait, boat rentals and fishing tackle are available nearby, and area restaurants provide a wide selection of meals to choose from.
