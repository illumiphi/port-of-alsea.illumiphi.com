- Boat Launch and Marina Construction
- Restroom Upgrades

===

Since the May, 2018 passage of a $2.5 Million Bond financing construction of a new Port of Alsea marina and boat ramp, the Port has been in an accelerated panning mode.

Though planned completion during the 2019/20 Winter in-water work period was interrupted by permitting delays,  the Port of Alsea boat ramp will now close for construction on October 29, 2020 and in-water construction is planned to finish-up by February 15, 2021.

The total project will be 5-phased:

1. A new boat ramp/storm-water-collection “bioswale” in cooperation with the Oregon State Marine Board and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
2. A new marina combined with an ADA Platform, Crabbing/Fishing/Kayak Launch Float sponsored by the Oregon Dept of Fish and Wildlife.
3. Mitigation involving removal of old concrete debris north and east of the Alsea Bay Bridge, as well as removal of an earthen dam near Eckman Lake.
4. Dredging in the marina area.
5. On-dock ladders/safety cabinets via a Special Districts Association of Oregon grant.

The balance of 2021 and beyond will see Port efforts to expand boat/trailer parking south and west of existing parking as well as pavement/marking of the Port’s existing east parking lot.

The Port has also already begun working with the Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Watershed Council along with local residents to improve the recreational facility of Eckman Lake.

Installation of a boat ramp on the Yachats River awaits a partnering river-front land owner.
