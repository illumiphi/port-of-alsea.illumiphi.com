Updates on the Port of Alsea Bond Measure Projects

===

## May, 2019 – Marina and Boat Launch Capital Project

The permits for construction of the boat launch, marina, and dredging are being written up now or are in the review process by the state and federal agencies.  The boat launch and marina facilities will probably be shut down the last week of October for staging equipment and materials before the construction work begins on or about November 1.

## April, 2019 -- First Bond Measure Project completed thanks to our Port of Alsea District voters!          

The bond measure approved by voters in 2018 provided for upgrades to the Port’s public restrooms.  In March, a request for bids resulted in a contractor being selected and work began at the end of the month.  The project was completed in April 2019, and what an improvement! 
 
The entire building was pressure washed, new, non-skid flooring was applied, and walls were given a new coat of paint. A new, metal roof, rain gutters and skylights were added.
In both the men’s and women’s restrooms, new green stall walls and doors went up, new and more efficient plumbing and new lighting fixtures were installed.
The entire facility is now much more welcoming and efficient for our visitors and should serve our Port well in the years to come.

## October 18, 2018 -- Port Commission selects contractor for Marina and Boat Launch Ramp. 
 
Five contractors submitted proposals to construct the boat launch and marina. After careful review, the Port sent out to all bidders a Notice of Intent to Award the contract to Bergerson Construction of Astoria.  Bergerson’s proposal met the criteria set by the selection committee and was also the lowest bid submitted for the project.

It will take the Port and Bergerson the next year to finalize the design of the marina and get permits in hand.  Construction of the marina and new boat launch ramp is expected to begin in November, 2019, when the in-water work period opens.

## September 2018 -- Bond Sale

Port bonds were sold September 12. The Port had estimated that the bonds would cost property owners $12.13 per $100,000. The cost came in a bit lower at $11.00 per $100,000.  Good news for property owners within the Port District!

## June 20, 2018 – Bond Measure Citizen’s Review Committee


Three community members who reside in the Port District have been selected to serve on a Citizens' Review Committee for the Bond Measure projects.  They represent residents along the east border of the Port District, the Yachats area, and the Waldport communities.  The five members of the Port's Budget Committee will also serve on the committee. 

The committee will meet no more than three (3) times a year.  The purpose of the committee is to review the financial transactions pertaining to the bond measure passed in May to ensure that the bond measure proceeds are not spent improperly.

## May 16, 2018 – Port of Alsea Bond Measure Won Voter Approval
 
The Port of Alsea gratefully thanks the voters and residents of the Port of Alsea District for the support and confidence they have shown by passing the Port's bond measure. The Port's commissioners and staff pledge to vigilantly watch the expenditures of the tax-payers’ money so the residents of the Port District will receive the maximum value for their dollars and trust. Thank you again.
