The Port of Alsea gratefully thanks the voters and residents of the Port of Alsea District for the support and confidence they have shown by passing the Port’s bond measure. The Port’s commissioners and staff pledge to vigilantly watch the expenditures of the taxpayers money so the residents of the Port District will receive the maximum value for their dollars and trust. Thank you again.
