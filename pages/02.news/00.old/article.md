Port of Alsea
December 5, 2019 ·

The Port of Alsea has scheduled a special meeting on Friday, December 13. A quorum of commissioners are traveling (at their own expense) to Bergerson Construction in Astoria to view the fabrication of the new marina floats. The purpose of the trip by the commissions to solely for the purpose of gathering information.

Two announcements from the Port of Alsea. We are now into our winter hours and the office is open Monday -Friday, 9-3. Second, on November 1 all payments for a daily launch will need to be made at the electronic pay station. The current pay box at the kiosk at the top of the boat launch will be removed. A third announcement - I am told the crabbing is good!

The Port of Alsea Commissioners held a special board meeting to discuss the marina construction schedule. For reasons too lengthy to go into, we do not yet have our permits from the Corps to build the marina and do the dredging. Our contractor was very reasonably concerned that by the time we received the necessary permits, he would not be able to complete the project within the four month in-water-work season. He recommended that we postpone the entire project until next year. The cost will stay the same. We asked how much extra it would cost to split the project and do the boat launch this year, and the marina, dredging, and mitigation projects next year. The extra cost is the extra mobilization and demobilization of the equipment that would be required. It would have cost an extra $100,000, which the Port cannot justify spending. So, the Port will not be closing on October 23 as we have been reporting. Instead, the Port will again be selling the annual launch passes and we will do the construction next year. Despite the huge disappointment, there are some silver linings. One is that the bulk of the bond money will remain in the investment account for an extra year, which will result in tens of thousands of dollars of accrued interest that can be used on capital projects. We will also find a way to have the kayak launch installed and functioning next spring rather than wait another year.

An update on the Port of Alsea boat launch and marina construction schedule. The west parking lot and the boat launch will still be closing on October 23 because the contractor plans to start on the boat launch. The marina work will probably not start until the end of November or early December. That means that people will be able to fish or crab on any of the docks until the contractor tells me to shut them down. I had a walk through with the contractor this afternoon. They may replace the ADA platform and install the new multi-use float before they start work on the marina, in which case there may be crabbing and fishing docks available throughout the construction process. The contractor is working on a detailed schedule now. If and when things change, I will let you know.

A quick reminder now that we are in our busy season a the Port of Alsea in Waldport. Please avoid driving through the boat launch if possible. The congestion is a problem now with the boats being put in and taken out. Please avoid using the boat launch as a street. Thank you!

Thought I should provide an update of the schedule around the marina construction project at the Port of Alsea in Waldport. The boat launch and the parking lots at the west and east ends of the Port facilities will all shut down at noon on October 23 and no boats will be allowed to remain in the marina except those belonging to the Dock of the Bay, Bill will remove his rental boats at the end of the day on October 28. All of the docks (except where Dock of the Bay moors its boats) will be open for recreational crabbing on October 24th until the end of the day on the 28th. On the morning of the 29th, the Port personnel will remove all remaining items from the Port marine facilities (left crab pots, etc.) and the marina facilities posted with the closure and chained off. The contractor has guaranteed that the new facilities will be completed by April 15, although I am hoping that the boat launch may open before then.

The roof still needs to go on, but the boat launch pay station at the Port of Alsea in Waldport is now operational. It takes credit and debit cards and $1 and $5 bills (you can put in 2 $5 bills, but it does not give change). Simply insert cards or bills and the ticket will drop into the bin. Be sure and place the ticket on your vehicle dash with the date showing.

You may have read in the News-Times that the Port of Alsea received a $162,500 grant toward the construction of the new boat launch from the Marine Board. We had applied for a $325,000 grant. The Marine Board had less money available than usuall, so it arranged with ODF&W to provide the additional $162,500 from the Sports Fishermen's Recovery fund. So, in total, we received the $325,000 grant that we had anticipated.

Thank you to Joel Hatzenbihler and his students at the Job Corps for pouring the slab for the new electronic pay station at the Port of Alsea. They will begin next week to construct a block surround to house the pay station. Lincoln County provided the funds to purchase the pay station. It will take credit cards and bills up to $10. It will not give change. We hope to have it operational by the end of July.

This picture was taken at a -1.3 low tide. We will dredge again this winter, but be sure to check your tide tables and depth finder this summer.
