Commissioner since 2011

===

Rob Bishop is a semiÂ­retired contractor. He and his wife, Randi, have lived in Waldport for 10 years. When he is not working as a contractor or donating his time to the Port of Alsea, he enjoys fishing, crabbing, boating, and spending time with their grandchildren. He views serving as a Port commissioner as his way to give back to the community.
