In 2011, the Port of Alsea commissioned a mural from local artist Casey McEneny to celebrate the Native American heritage of our region.  The mural is located on Hwy101 in downtown Waldport, and is most visible when travelling north.

A number of months ago, Port of Alsea Board of Commissioners Chairman John Johnson proposed the idea of having a mural painted in downtown Waldport depicting the first peoples to settle in the area. . .the Alsea Indians.  Community members seemed to like the idea so John approached the Port and the City of Waldport about the proposal and the Waldport Mural project was born.  The Port and the City each committed $5,000 for the project with the balance to be funded by donations and grants.  The Waldport Samaritan Clinic has contributed the south wall of their facility to display the project.  In May, 2011, proposals were submitted by 10 artists and in June, the McEneny proposal was selected.

In his submittal, McEneny stated he wanted to ". . .represent the past history and the people of the Alsea and Tribe.  I also wanted to incorporate modern and contemporary aspects of the natural culture and how it has transformed over a span of time."

McEneny has been allowed the use of the Waldport Football Stadium interior to work on the project.  Currently, a little over half of the 10x48-foot mural is hanging on the wall and is nearing completion.  The mural depicts a past generation of the Alsea on the left and visually intertwines Native American stylistic qualities across the panel to a modern-day tribal woman in ceremonial dress.  The mural is being created on portable panels so that it may be moved to another site if necessary.

The artist, Casey McEneny, grew up in the south County and attended Waldport High School.  After graduation he moved to southern California to pursue a Master's Degree in Art and, in 2008, received his Master's of Fine Arts from California State Long Beach.  He returned to Lincoln County and continues to pursue his artistic career.  He is an Art Teacher at Newport High School and is involved in promoting art in non-profit and after-school programs all over Lincoln County.

The Port is continuing to accept donations to help pay for the mural.  Those interested in contributing should designate the Port of Alsea as the recipient and include "Mural Project on the contribution.  Contributions may be dropped off at the Port Office located at 365 NE Port Street, in Waldport, or mail to Port of Alsea, PO Box 1060, Waldport, Oregon 97394.

Port Manager Maggie Rivers, as well as the Port's Board of Commissioners, feel the mural is a great addition to the city of Waldport.  They hope this is only the first of a series of murals depicting local history that can be enjoyed by area residents and visitors to our community.
