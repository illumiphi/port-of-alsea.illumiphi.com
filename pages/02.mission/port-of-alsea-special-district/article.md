The Port of Alsea District encompasses an area that has its northern border at Marsh Street south of Seal Rock.  The Port’s southern border is the Lincoln County/Lane County line, and the Lincoln County/Benton County line designates the eastern border.  The west boundary extends from Marsh Street down the Coast to Yachats.

The Port of Alsea was established in 1911, before Highway 101 was constructed.  The State Legislature requires by statute that ports and their activities, with some exceptions, be associated with water.  As a result, all of the Port of Alsea facilities and properties are currently located on the Alsea Bay and the Alsea River.

The facilities are comprised of the Port office, the boat launch and marina, parking lots, the Port maintenance shop, public bathrooms, and Robinson Park.  The Port also owns properties in the immediate vicinity of the office and marina which are leased out to local businesses – the Salty Dawg restaurant, Dock of the Bay boat rental and bait shop, and the Shrimp Daddy bait shrimp operations.

The Port also owns some vacant properties on the Alsea Bay and Alsea River, as well as 19 acres of Lint Slough and also Eckman Lake.
