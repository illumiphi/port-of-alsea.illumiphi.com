The mission of the Port of Alsea is to promote the business development potential of Port District assets and to preserve, protect, and promote the ecological, aesthetic and economic resources of the Alsea and Yachats River systems, and the interests of those who enjoy them.

The Port District was formed in 1910 and includes the communities of Waldport, Yachats and Tidewater. The Port holds land in public trust throughout much of the Alsea estuary up to mean high tide, as surveyed in 1912.

Crabbing is among the best in the state, and the bay also offers excellent salmon fishing and clamming.   Public docks for crabbing, fishing, and moorage, a launch ramp, Robinson Park and picnic area, are among the facilities available in the Port area.  Many private marinas along the river provide similar services.

Alsea Bay and River have over 50,000 user days by boaters annually, according to BOATING IN OREGON, Results of the 1999 Triennial Survey, by the Oregon State Marine Board.  http://www.boatoregon.com

Annually, more than 5000 boats are launched from the Port’s launch ramp.  Boaters from 127 Oregon cities and at least ten other states use Port facilities. Virtually all of the boats using Alsea Bay and River are trailered, with the average length of the vessel between 14-18 feet overall.

The Alsea is one of the most pristine estuaries on the Oregon Coast, and offers excellent opportunities for recreation. The Port of Alsea provides easy access to your bay and river adventures. Catch your own Dungeness crab and fish the fall run of Chinook salmon. Take a relaxing walk along a quiet beach and enjoy the small town flavor of Waldport and Yachats. Follow the tide up the Alsea River to forested campgrounds and sunny swimming holes.  Put in your kayak and canoes to explore the Alsea and Yachats Rivers.

The Port office is located at 365 Port Street, on the waterfront in Waldport, Oregon.  The Port’s public facilities include a launch ramp, boat moorage, and a picnic area. An accessible viewing platform give visitors a close up look at marine life while crabbing. Crab rings, bait, boat rentals and fishing tackle are available nearby, and area restaurants provide a wide selection of meals to choose from.
