# Preparation for Closing of Marina Facilities
Robby has begun taking down things on the docks that we want to retain.  He has taken down the aluminum gate on the commercial dock and that is now stored in the shop.  I don’t know that we will have a use for it, but it is worth something if we don’t.  I have purchased a new Milwaukee drill that should be here by the 23rd.  The drill head was stripped and will be needed to remove the screws on the signs we need to take down.  We will also remove the kiosk at the top of the ramp when the launch is closed.  I have asked Robby to find a way to keep people from sneaking in and using the fish cleaning station when we are shut down.  Even though the water was shut off, it was a problem in November and early December when we closed the parking lot for dredging.  I want to be able to have Dahl’s can at the cleaning station removed during construction because that can costs us money, plus the garbage trucks need to get into the parking lot to empty it.  I want to try to eliminate as much non-construction traffic in the parking lot as possible.

# Dock of the Bay
Robby has retained an attorney to protect his interest in the Dock of the Bay.  Jim Hill wanted to go to the meeting Robby had with his attorney, but Robby chose to retain his own attorney.  Robby’s attorney said that he would talk with Brian Haggerty, Kim Thissell’s attorney, to get information on the value of the Dock of the Bay.

# Strategic Business Plan
We need to update our Strategic Business Plan next year.  After the marina facilities are closed, I plan to start going through our current plan to see what is involved in updating it.  We can probably get a grant from Business Oregon to help with the costs.  I don’t know if they will provide a grant to cover the costs.  It is something I will look into.

# 2020 Newsletter
I will start the 2020 newsletter in November and plan to have it mailed out by the end of the year, which is when it went out last year.  It will allow me to include the first 45 days of the construction project.  After that, I may go back to doing the newsletter in the summer, which allow us to put out a newsletter soon after construction is completed.

# Shrimp Daddy / Alsea Bay Crabbing Co.
I spoke with Mike Gaten about whether he intended to continue renting the shop and he told me he is.  He acknowledged he owed two month’s rent and that he needed to get a check into the office, but so far, I haven’t seen it.  Troy Smith, who owns the Alsea Bay Crabbing Co., has consistently paid early.  He says his business has been good and that he is getting repeat customers now. I think it really helped that he put two picnic tables out for seating.  It looks much more inviting.  He has also be modifying his menu.
