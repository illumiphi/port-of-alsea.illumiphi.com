Port of Alsea Regular Commission Meeting

# I. CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary Buster Pankey, and Joe Rohleder were present.  Commissioner Pavlik was absent. 

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  No members of the public or the media attended.

# II. APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the September 20, 2018 Minutes and the October Financial Report.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 4-0.

# III. MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar reported to the commissioners that Troy Smith, owner of the Alsea Bay Crab Co., a food cart on Port property, was closing down for the year.  He paid $500 toward his bill and would pay another $500 in the next couple of weeks.  He said he has learned a lot during the first year of operations and is looking forward to opening again in the spring.

Cuellar told the commissioners that she had put all but $60,000 of the Bond Fund money into the State of Oregon Local Government Investment Pool, which was currently paying 2.5% interest.  She explained that she did not put any of the money into treasury bills as the board had indicated last month, because the commissioners had made that contingent upon the interest rate being comparable with the state investment pool.  When she spoke again with the investment manager associated with Columbia Bank, she learned that the interest rate on 12-month treasury bills was only 2.3 percent.  For that reason, she put all but $60,000 into the investment pool.  Given the interest rate, she recommended to the commissioners that a second account be established for the general fund as well.  Currently the $60,000 12-month CD at Oregon Coast Bank was only paying 0.6% interest.  The Port would make more money by paying the early retirement penalty on the CD and put the money into the state investment pool.

Cuellar related to the Board that the Lincoln County tax revenues were now being deposited into the Port’s account.  She showed them how the county broke out the deposit into the money for the bond fund and the money for the general fund.

Cuellar told the commissioners that Amy Greer would be working with her after the first of the year to set up payroll on QuickBooks.
 

# IV. PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

There was no public comment.

# V.  OLD BUSINESS

## A. Square versus Columbia Bank VISA

Cuellar told the commissioners that while the Port may save a small amount of money using the Columbia Bank VISA processing during the busy months of August through October, over all, it was better to stay with Square because, unlike Columbia Bank, there was no monthly fee.  The Board concurred.

## B. 	Marina Project

Cuellar and the commissioners reviewed the six-hour workshop held with Bergerson Construction and Jon Keiser, PND Engineering, at the Port office on Wednesday, November 7, 2018.  The Board reviewed the agenda and the minutes of the workshop provided by Greg Morrill, Bergerson Construction.  Eric Campbell, Campbell Environmental, also attended the meeting, to describe his efforts with respect to the permit process.  It was agreed that Pankey and Pavlik would take Morrill and Campbell in Pankey’s boat to the possible mitigation site after the special Board meeting was over. 

## C.   	Guptil’s Fence

Bishop reported that he had again spoken to the owner of Koi Pond about providing the Port with a bid on the construction of the fence.  Bishop said he received a bid a few days later, but considered it very high.  He was going to inquire about having the Job Corps build the fence.

## D.  	Parking

Cuellar told the Board that she would continue to look for solutions to the shortage of parking at the Port.  The Port was able to add three additional truck / boat trailer spaces the past season behind the shop buildings.  Bishop noted that paving that parking lot may also be necessary.  Using part of Robinson Park may also be a future option if enough spaces could be created to justify the costs.  Bishop said that the Marine Board will often provide the engineering for boat trailer parking.

# VI. NEW BUSINESS

## A.   	Christmas Dinner

The commissioner selected December 16, 2018 at 5:00 for the Board’s Christmas dinner at the Adobe Resort in Yachats.

## B.  	General Fund Money in State Investment Pool

This item was discussed under the Manager’s Report.  Power moved that the Port open a second account in the state investment pool and deposit money into it from the general fund.  The manger would determine the appropriate amount.

## C.   	Letter from Adam Springer to Coos Bay

Cuellar told the Board she had asked the Port’s attorney, Adam Springer, to send a letter to the Port of Coos Bay requesting that it provide documentation to support its Invoice #21854 that was sent to the Port of Alsea as part of the dredging project in 2016-2017.  The Port of Alsea needs to close the FEMA claim and Invoice #21854 was submitted to Oregon Emergency Management (OEM) by the Port of Coos Bay for reimbursement.  It was rejected by OEM for lack of documentation.  The Port of Alsea had received an extension until January 1, 2019 on its FEMA claim.  The purpose of the letter by Springer was to let the Port of Coos Bay know that there was a deadline of December 13 to submit the documentation.

	
# IX. COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Power told the commissioners that local kayakers hoped that the Port could purchase the proposed kayak launch and install it for the 2019 season so it could be tried out before the new marina was constructed.  Power had provided the cost estimates and the diagrams of the proposed launch to the commissioners, as well as Bergerson Construction and PND Engineering, at the workshop on November 7, 2018.

# X. 	ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 3:50.
