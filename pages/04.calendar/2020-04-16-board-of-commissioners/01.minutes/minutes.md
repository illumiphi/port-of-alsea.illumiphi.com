April 16, 2020 Minutes
Port of Alsea Regular Commission Meeting by Teleconference

# I. CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Secretary / Treasurer Jan Power, Chuck Pavlik, and Joe Rohleder were present.  Rohleder reconnected to the teleconference at 2:20. Commissioner Buster Pankey was excused.

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  No members of the public or media were present.

# II. APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the consent calendar of the February 20, 2020 Regular Meeting Minutes, and the February and March Financials.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 4-0.  No minutes exist for a March meeting; the March meeting was cancelled because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

# III. MANAGER’S REPORT

The written Manager’s Report is incorporated into the minutes by reference.

# IV. PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

There were no public comments.


# V. OLD BUSINESS

As a result of the FY 2018 / 2019 audit, the Port was required by the Secretary of State’s Audit Division to submit a Plan of Action to cure deficiencies identified by the Port’s auditor Anthony Wilder.  The commissioners reviewed the letter describing the deficiencies and the Plan of Action prepared by Cuellar.  Power moved to approve the Plan of Action and Pavlik seconded her motion. The motion was approved 3-0.

# VI.  NEW BUSINESS

Power moved to reappoint Mark Wiederhold and Diana Buckley to the Budget Committee.  Pavlik seconded the motion.  The motion passed 3-0.

# VII.  COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Pavlik asked if there was any possibility that the marina construction project would be delayed.  Cuellar explained there wasn’t for two reasons.  First, state law requires that 85% of bond funds have to be expended within three years after the sale of the bonds, which would mean by September 11, 2021.  That could not happen if the project was put off another year.  Second, almost all of the materials for the project have been or are being fabricated and being stored by Bergerson and other manufacturers.  No one would want to store the materials for an additional year.

Pavlik also asked if we could charge a $3.00 fee, in addition to the $7.00 launch fee dedicated to dredging funds.  Cuellar said that she would need to check with Oregon State Marine Board to find out its reaction.  The Port is already over the $5.00 limit that the Marine Board imposes on launching fees without becoming ineligible for maintenance grant funds.  Because the Marine Board is providing a Boating Facilities Grant for the construction of the boat launch, it may have restrictions on additional fees linked solely to launching.  Cuellar agreed that the Port needs to come up with a plan to put money aside for dredging down the road.

Bishop asked Pavlik and Rohleder how their knee surgeries in March had gone and how they were doing.  Both indicated that they were becoming more mobile.

# VIII. THE MEETING WAS ADJOURNED AT 2:50.
