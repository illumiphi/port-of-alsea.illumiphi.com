# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar told the commissioners that she had told Sharon Scarborough that she and any commissioners would not be able look at the property until after early September.  She said that worked out fine for them.  Cuellar told the commissioners that the Port had gone to twice a week pickups for garbage Service and that Dahl’s had increased the cost of their once-a-week service from $340 to $399.  She also told the commissioners that the garbage cans that had burned on 4th of July had been rebuilt and that the parking in the east parking lot seemed to be working efficiently.  Cuellar also showed the commissioners the moorage reservations for the week of September 23rd, and noted that moorage during all of September was filling up.

# OLD BUSINESS

## Sale of the Bonds
Cuellar reviewed the time line for the sale of the G. O. Bonds.  If everything stays on schedule, the proceeds from the sale of the bonds should be deposited into the Port bank account on either September 12 or 13.

## Meeting with the Marine Board

Cuellar, Bishop, and Pankey met with Janine Belleque and Scott Janssen at the Oregon State Marine Board in Salem on July 17, 2018.  The purpose of the meeting was to work out the coordination of the construction of the boat launch and the construction of the marina under a single contractor, using the design-build RFP.  While the marina will be a design build project, the boat launch will be designed and engineered by the Marine Board.  The Marine Board will plan to have staff attend the Interviews for the selection of the contractor to build the boat launch and marina.

## Request for Proposals (RFPs) for Marina Construction

Because the drawings for the marina are not yet completed, the RFP advertising occur on July 26, but will be delayed for at least two weeks.  Adam Springer, the Port’s attorney, will provide new dates when a new draft of the RFP is provided to the commissioners.

## Reimbursement from Business Oregon

Cuellar told the commissioners she had met with Business Oregon and that she would be submitting a request for reimbursement in the next two weeks.

## Review of Jon Holbrook’s Design

Cuellar provided the commissioners with another draft of the proposed marina from Jon Holbrook and asked them to provide any additional changes they want.

# NEW BUSINESS

## RFP Time Line

Because the RFP could not be put out as scheduled on July 26, Cuellar asked the commissioners if there were dates that Springer should avoid for the Pre-Proposal Conference and the Interviews.  Rohleder said he would be gone from mid-August until the end of August.  Bishop said he and his wife usually take their vacation for two weeks sometime after Labor Day.  Cuellar said she would ask Springer to come up with dates for the two meetings that would avoid those conflicts.

## Contractor Selection Committee

By consensus, the commissioners decided that the Interview Committee would be made up of the five commissioners, Bud Shoemake, general manager at the Port of Toledo, and at least one representative from the Marine Board.  The final selection would be made by the Port Commissioners.

# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Rohleder told the Board that he was writing a letter to ODF&F to have someone attend a Port Board meeting to inform the Board about sand shrimp harvesting.  The rest of the commissioners comments centered around Eckman Lake and what the Port, as the owner of Eckman Lake, could do to clean up the lake of the algae growth.  Cuellar said she would talk with Kerry Kemp, the Waldport City Manager, about the Port’s interest.

# ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:30.
