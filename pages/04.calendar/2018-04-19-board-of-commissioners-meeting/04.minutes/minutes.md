# OLD BUSINESS

## Nick Rust, Maintenance Employee

## Food Carts / Site Prep

Cuellar told the Board that Troy Smith had purchased his food cart and making the improvements needed.  He was working with the Department of Agriculture and ODF&W to secure all of the needed permits.  Pavlik said it was important that he have set hours that he is open.  Cuellar said he had already mentioned which days he would be open but she would check on hours and days.


## 2018 / 2019 Budget Committee Meeting

Cuellar reminded the Board that the Budget Committee Meeting will be May 10, 2018.  The budget documents submitted to the Budget Committee assumes that the bond measure passed.  If the bond measure did not pass, all pages and line items impacted by the bond measure would be removed and the budget officer will recommend to the commissioners, during the budget hearing, that the budget resolution passed reflect those changes.

## 2018 / 2019 Budget Hearing

The commissioners discussed again when the budget hearing would be held.  It was decided to hold the regular May board meeting and the budget hearing on Wednesday, May 23, at 2:00.


# NEW BUSINESS

## Proposed and Accepted Boat Launch Mitigation Plan

Cuellar told the commissioners that Derek Wilson at ODF&W had approved the mitigation plan that Pavlik had proposed and had sent pictures of the concrete walls to Carrie Landrum at DSL.  She has also approved the mitigation project.  This will enable to permit on the boat launch to move forward.  She advised the Board that she had determined the owner of the parcel above or where the concrete walls are located.  She said that she would have to do a bit of research to try and determine where the parcel ends.  It is possible that the Port sold the ground between median low and median high and none of the concrete is on Port property.

## Solar Lights for the Marina

Cuellar told the Board that the Port received $187 in the donation box at the top of the gangway to the docks.  She is looking at purchasing solar lights with the money to be installed on the docks, probably attached to the pilings.


# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Pankey told the commissioners that he would be pulling out four of the floats on the boarding floats to repair three of them.  He had previously repaired one of them but would be removing it as well.  Before the floats are put back, new gravel would be put on top of the riprap so the floats would sit level.  Pavlik noted that there are rods in the shop.

# ADJOURNMENT
