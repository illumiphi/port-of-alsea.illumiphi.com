# CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary Buster Pankey, Joe Rohleder, and Chuck Pavlik were present.

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	   No member of the public was present.  The media did not attend.

# APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the July 26 Meeting Minutes, and the July Financial Report.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 5-0.

# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar related the meeting she had with Kerry Kemp, Waldport City Manager, about Eckman Lake.  Kemp was not aware that the Port owned Eckman Lake, but he said the timing for a discussion about water issues pertaining to the City’s usage was timely because the City is about halfway through the completion of its Facility Plan under its Comprehensive Plan.  Cuellar talked with him about the concern that the City’s use of the water from Eckman and Weist Creeks during the summer prevented the lake from being flushed out and promoted the growth of algae in the lake.  Cuellar told Kerry that one commissioner had suggested that perhaps the dam could be enlarged to hold more water from the winter rains, reducing the need to take water from the creeks.  Kerry said that was financially unfeasible.  The City has other water rights but they are four miles away, which also poses a financial barrier.  Kerry said the City was looking into sharing water capacity with other water districts, as well as constructing water storage tanks to provide additional water for City needs during the summer.  Cuellar and Kerry agreed that it was a long-term problem and could best be resolved by the two entities working together on a solution.

Cuellar told the commissioners that the Port received its August invoice for payment toward its Business Oregon loan.  She requested that the Port be given a one-month extension so the payment could be made from the proceeds of the bond measure and Business Oregon agreed to the extension.

She related that the Transition Dock, now C Dock) between A and B Docks has had cleats added and numbered from 1-3 to provide additional moorage when needed.

Cuellar had reported vandalism to the Sheriff’s office after a series of letters left about the Port had led to messages being written inside the disabled stall in the men’s bathroom.  Awbrey Skinner had tied his boat to the dock when it broke down but did not properly secure it and did not take it out of the marina as he had indicated he would.  Bill (Dock of the Bay) had seen the boat being beaten against the dock in the heavy winds and had four guys move it to B-12, which is more sheltered, but the boat had already suffered damage.  Skinner assumed that the boat had been vandalized and blamed the Port for not finding the culprit on the security tapes.  Cuellar and Bishop had watched the tape and could see activity on the dock near the boat, but nothing that indicated the boat was being vandalized.  However, it was difficult to see anything well because of the poor lighting.  Cuellar recommended that the commissioners consider better security for the docks when the new marina is constructed.

Cuellar told the commissioners that the Port had not yet received rent from the food cart owned by the Alsea Bay Crabbing Company.  She intended to follow up with Troy Smith, the owner, to determine the problem.  He had told her that he had medical issues, but she did not know if that was the source of the problem or not.

# PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

There was no public comment.

# OLD BUSINESS

## Sale of the Bonds

Cuellar told the commissioners that the G. O. Bonds would be sold on the 29th of August, that she would need to go to Portland on the 11th of September to Ann Sherman’s office, the Port’s bond attorney, to sign the closing documents, and the proceeds from the sale of the bonds would be put into the Port bank account on September 12, 2018.

## RFP on the Marina Project

Cuellar reported that the mandatory Pre-Proposal meeting would be an official board meeting so that all of the commissioners could get an opportunity to be present at the first participation by the contractors who might put in proposals on the marina project.  The deadline for submitting proposals would be September 20 at 2:00 PM, with interviews scheduled for October 4, 2018.  That would also be a scheduled board meeting so all of the commissioners can participate in interviewing the contractors about their proposals.

## RFP Schedule and Procedures

See above.

## Permit Process

Cuellar told the commissioners that she was starting the permit process on the marina with the goal of turning it over to the contractor when one is selected.  She would also be finishing up the boat launch permit by describing the proposed mitigation project.


# NEW BUSINESS

## Weighted Ropes for Crab Pots in the Marina

Cuellar said that she would be proposing in the next few months that crabbers within the marina be required to use weighted lines for crabbing, with the idea of not enforcement it next year, but begin enforcing it after the new marina is completed in 2020.

## Reducing Congestion at the Launch

Cuellar told the commissioners that she had put out a request on social media that people not drive through the boat launch area if they can avoid it during the busy part of the season.  The goal would be to reduce the amount of congestion at the ramp, if possible.

# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Pankey told the commissioners that he, Nick Rust, and Robby Hensen had changed the thru-rods on A Dock, which stabilized the dock.  He believes it will last through the winter until the new marina is put in.

Pavlik related that the Alsea Sportsman’s Association held its meeting the previous Friday and that Eckman Lake was the principal topic.  He said the members understood that efforts to clean up the lake would be a long-term project.

Power discussed the new website that was being constructed.  The process had been more difficult than first anticipated because of the initial difficulty of getting all of the needed passwords from Lisa Gray, who constructed the previous website.

Power also discussed the Port posting any closures on the Alsea Bay by ODF&W.  Cuellar said that ODF&W came to the Port and posted signs at three locations at the Port when there was a closure.  They also came and removed the signs when the closure was lifted.  Cuellar recommended that the Port post the number that people can call to check the closures rather than have the Port be responsible for posting the lifting of the closure on the morning that happens.

# ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:05.
