Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	   No members of the public or the media attended.

# APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the August 16, 2018 Regular Meeting Minutes, and the August Financial Report.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 4-0.

# EXECUTIVE SESSION

The Board went into Executive Session.

# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar told the Board that she and Commissioner Rohleder had met with Senator Roblin about the problems with the invoices the Port had received from the Port of Coos Bay with respect to the dredging.  She said she thought from Roblin’s comments that he understood the issue and wanted to try to resolve it.  She told the Board she had heard that Troy Smith, owner of the Alsea Bay Crab Company, was having medical problems and was not able to work that much.  She was going to check with him about the status of his lease to see if the Port needed to add additional language to protect itself if Smith was not able to continue with the lease.

Cuellar told the Board that she would be attending the annual OPPA convention in Coos Bay the first week of October.  She noted that the commercial crabbing was down considerably because of the poor crabbing conditions.  She also told the commissioners that she had to report the local ambulance service to their supervisor because they were parking in the boat launch area to eat their lunch.  The last time they parked there, they were parked at the top of the launch with their lights flashing, causing confusion to the boaters who were wanting to launch.  Cuellar told the Board that the marina was consistently full for moorage during September.  She also cautioned the commissioners to avoid ex parte contacts with the public with respect to the selection of a contractor for the marina project.

# PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

There was no public comment.

# OLD BUSINESS

## Sale of the Bonds Requirements

Cuellar told the Board that the bonds had sold on September 12 and $2,477,399.91 was deposited into the Port account at Columbia Bank.  The balance owed on the Business Oregon had been paid off as part of the closing of the bonds.  After the closing, Cuellar paid $20,000 to Municipal Advisor, David Ulbricht (SDAO) and $8,750 to Zion Bank.  The Port was waiting for a $9,000 invoice from Moody’s.  As part of closing, a condition was imposed that the debt service payments due on December 15 and June 15 would need to be made on December 1 and June 1.  The underwriter was concerned that, because the Port of Alsea is so small, it might inadvertently miss a payment.

## RFP Schedule and Procedures

Cuellar explained that the proposals from the contractors were due at 2:00 on Friday, November 28.  She planned to have copies of digital proposals and the hard copy proposals available for the commissioners to pick up by 4:00 on the 28th.  The Board would meet in Executive Session on October 11 to discuss which contractors they wished to interview on the 16th and would also, at that meeting, decide how they wished to invest the bond funds.  The Board would meeting again on the 17th to finish interviews if necessary and to select the contractor.

## Coos Bay Invoice

This was covered under the Manager’s Report.

## Citizens’ Review Committee Board Member

Cuellar told the commissioners that the first meeting of the Citizens Review Committee to review the bond expenditures was scheduled for Tuesday, September 25, at 5:30.  She asked the Board if they wanted to appoint a commissioner to attend the meetings.  She explained that, unlike, many committees, this one would not be making policy recommendations but would only be reviewing deposits and expenditures of the bond funds.  For that reason, she felt it was option whether the commissioners have presence at the meetings.  Commissioner Power felt it was import for the committee to know the commissioners also involved and she volunteered to act as the Board’s liaison.  Rohleder suggested that the board simply proposed to have a board member there, so if Power could not attend, another commissioner would.  It was agreed that the board would have a member attend the meetings and that Power would do that unless she was not able.

# NEW BUSINESS

## Bathroom Update

Cuellar told the Board that upgrading the public bathrooms with the bond funds could be done this winter and the public could begin to see some of the results of the bond measure.  She encouraged the commissioners to examine the public bathrooms to see what types of improvements they would like to see.

## Investment of Bond Funds

Cuellar provided the commissioners with copies of the Oregon Local Government Investment Fund information packet, but there was pages missing.  Cuellar told the commissioners that she was not able to discuss investment options with Sheri Williams at Columbia Bank or Linda Eriksen at Oregon Coast Bank because they were both on vacation.  Bishop said he thought the board should wait to make a decision when Commissioner Pavlik could weight in as well.  The decision was made to postpone the decision until the Board’s October 11 meeting.

## Future Monthly Bank Statement Reconciliation

Cuellar told the commissioners that they would see a new version of the bank statement reconciliation in their October regular meeting packet because the bond funds had been deposited into the Port bank account at Columbia Bank and had been separated from the general fund money in QuickBooks.

# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Rohleder told the commissioners that he felt more comfortable that the issues with the Port of Coos Bay would be resolved after speaking with Senator Roblin.  Pankey told the commissioners that there was quite a bit of dirt behind the wall at the mitigation site, but that should not prevent the removal of the wall for mitigation.

# ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 3:45.
