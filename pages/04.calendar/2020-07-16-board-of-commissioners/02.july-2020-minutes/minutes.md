# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar discussed the Port leases with the Shrimp Daddy, Alsea Bay Crab Co., and the Dock of the Bay.  Mike Gaten, owner of the Shrimp Daddy, was using more slip spaces than he was allowed under his lease.  Cuellar told him he would need to remove some of his boats because the commercial dock would be needed for mooring other boats.  He agreed to do so.  Cuellar told the commissioners that Troy Smith, owner of the Alsea Bay Crab Co., had been paying his monthly rent on time.  He had had another surgery because of his cancer in June, but seemed to be in otherwise good health now.  She told the board that Bill Ternyila, owner of the Dock of the Bay, had been in poor health for about two months and had not been able to work at the Dock of the Bay as he normally would.

Cuellar informed the Board that she was planning to use Nick Rust as much as his doctor would allow to help out the Port during the busy season because Robby Hensen is putting in more hours that he normally would at the Dock of the Bay.  She would use Rust on Saturdays for three hours and may eventually have him fill in on Sundays and Mondays, her days off.

Cuellar told the Board she would be buying an exterior camera and microphone for the office computer to attend the online Oregon State Marine Board meeting on August 27 to speak to the Port’s two Marine Board grants for the kayak launch and for paving the west parking lot.  She said the combination camera / microphone costs less than $50.00.

Cuellar informed the commissioners that the Southwest Lincoln County Water PUD on which she serves has changed it meeting date to the third Wednesday of the month at 10:00.  She told the board that, while having the SWLCWPUD meeting the day before the Port’s board meeting was less convenient that she would like, she shouldn’t have a problem making it work without having it create a problem for the Port.

Cuellar noted that she has begun to get calls about the commercial licenses from both fishing guides and commercial crabbers.  She asked the board, given that the Port will be closing for construction in October, if the Port should reduce the commercial rates for this year.  The commissioners indicated they would prefer to leave the rates as they are.

# PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

There were no public comments.

# OLD BUSINESS

## Marina Grants

Cuellar told the commissioners that she had a phone call from the Marine Board and Jennifer Peterson explained to her that the $17,000 that the Port has already paid toward the float where the kayak launch will be located should be considered the match that the Port would be putting up as the match for the WAG grant.  This means that the Port will be putting up a 37% match of the $45,000 grant and OSMB, assuming that the grant is awarded, would pay $28,000.

## Port Finances

Cuellar told the commissioners that, ironically, the Port is having a very good year so far, and part of that is probably attributable to COVID-19.  Boating is something that people can do while easily maintaining social distancing and it gives them an opportunity to be outside.  She reminded the commissioners that August and September last year had been unusually slow, but she was hopeful that the Port would remain busy until it shut down for construction.

## Painting the Office

Commissioner Pankey suggested that the commissioners and staff paint the office building the Monday following this meeting and commissioners who were able to do so agreed that would work.

## Fire Department Boat House

Cuellar informed the Board that she had spoken with two staff people from the Central Oregon Fire and Rescue.  They came to the office to find out if the entire marina project had been cancelled.  Cuellar assured them it was going to happen this winter.  The new assistant chief had heard that the project had been cancelled rather than postponed.  The fire staff told Cuellar that the new assistant chief was very good at writing grants and Cuellar told them she would get in touch with him to discuss applying for grants for the fire house at the marina.

# NEW BUSINESS

## Additional Marina / Launch Needs

Cuellar informed the commissioners that she had requested that Bergerson Construction provide the Port with samples of the grated surfaces for the new marina floats so the Port could determine how accessories such as cleats and lighting can be attached.  She also asked Bergerson if they could provide estimates of costs if the Port asked Bergerson to provide and install some of the accessories.

## Eckman Lake

Cuellar told the commissioners that the Midcoast Watershed Council would like to assist the Port in providing outreach to stakeholders, property owners located near Eckman Lake, and Port District residents.  Evan Hayduk would be submitting a grant request to the Water Resources Board for various projects and would like to include a grant for the Eckman Lake outreach.  He asked if the Port could send a letter of support and, if possible, some matching funds for the grant.  He mentioned $1,000 to $2,000.  After discussing the amount of the match the Port should provide, the commissioners agreed by consensus to provide a $2,000 match.

# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Pankey said he would pick up the paint sprayer, paint, and other materials to paint the office on Monday, July 20.  Cuellar said she would contact Cherie Brubaker to take pictures for the Newport News-Times.  Pavlik said the topic of kayaks came up at an Alsea Sportsman’s Association meeting.  Someone related that people have fallen out of kayaks and been carried under the docks.  He recommended that we have signs warning of that danger.  Bishop noted that our new grated floats will provide light and air for anyone that was swept under the floats.  The new float will also have ladders and safety cabinets with life rings, which should help as well.  Bishop made the recommendation that the Port consider having its board meetings by teleconference again.  It was agreed that Cuellar would poll the commissioners before the next board meeting to see how the commissioners wanted to hold the August meeting.


# THE MEETING WAS ADJOURNED AT 3:50.
