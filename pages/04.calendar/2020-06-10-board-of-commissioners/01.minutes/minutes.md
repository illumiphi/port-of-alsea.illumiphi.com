Port of Alsea Special Commission Meeting

# I. CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:30.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary Buster Pankey, Chuck Pavlik, and Joe Rohleder were present. 

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  

# II. NEW BUSINESS

## A. Oregon State Marine Board Grants

Cuellar explained to the commissioners that the Port should consider applying for two OSMB grants:  one was a Waterway Access Grant (WAG) to help pay for the kayak launch and the other was a Boating Facility Grant (BFG) to provide financial assistance to finish paving the west parking lot.  Cuellar provided materials that described the grants and that estimated the cost of the kayak launch at $40,000 and the cost of the paving project at $35,000.  The question before the commissioners was how much of a match to provide in the two applications.  The higher the match, the more likely that the grant would be awarded.  Cuellar suggested that the more important of the two grants was the WAG because any grant money received would reduce the amount of bond money spent on the marina project, which would free up money for dredging or other capital projects the commissioners chose to pursue.

The commissioners, by consensus, decided to provide a 35% match for the WAG application and a 25% match for the BFG application.

# III. 	ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 3:45.
