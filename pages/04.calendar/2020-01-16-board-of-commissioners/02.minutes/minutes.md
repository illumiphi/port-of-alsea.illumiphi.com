January 16, 2020 Minutes
Port of Alsea Regular Commission Meeting

    I. CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary / Treasurer Buster Pankey, Chuck Pavlik, and Joe Rohleder were present.

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  Shauna Reimer was present.

    II. ELECTION OF OFFICERS

Cuellar told the commissioners that she would not usually make recommendations about the election of board officers, but the recommendations made by the Port’s auditor Tony Wilder led her to suggest that Power be the secretary / treasurer.  The new procedure for having a commissioner approve invoices and then sign the computer generated checks with Cuellar led Cuellar to make her suggestion because of Power’s general availability.  Cuellar said she had previously spoken with Power and Power had agreed to act as Secretary / Treasurer if that is what the board chose to do.

Power moved that Bishop be named Board President, Buster Pankey as Vice-President, and Power as Secretary / Treasurer.  Rohleder seconded the motion and the motion passed 5-0. 

    III. APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the consent calendar of the November 21, 2019 Regular Meeting Minutes and the December 13, 2019 Special Meeting Minutes, and the November and December financials.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 5-0.

    IV. MANAGER’S REPORT

The written Manager’s Report is incorporated into the minutes.

    V. PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

Shauna Reimer told the commissioners that she would be purchasing the Dock of the Bay.  Cuellar asked if the Dock of the Bay had been put up for sale, since the Port has just signed a new 5-year lease with the Dock of the Bay in December.  She reminded commissioners that they would need to approve any transfer of the lease to Reimer.  Cuellar told the commissioners that she would discuss the sale with Bill Ternyila, the owner of the Dock of the Bay, and relay the information she receives to the commissioners.
  
    VI. OLD BUSINESS

    A.   	Personnel Manual

Cuellar provided the commissioners with copies of the current personal policies with regard to vacation, sick, and holiday pay.  She noted that the current policies were more than twenty years old and that some parts of the policies may no longer be legal.  She told the commissioners that they could review the sample personnel policies they had received at the November meeting and perhaps be prepared to discuss and adopt new policies at the February board meeting.


    VII.  NEW BUSINESS

    A.  	SDIS Property Insurance

Cuellar provided the commissioners with the new proposed SDIS property insurance coverage and noted that the premium had increased significantly and principally for two reasons:  The increased coverage for the Dock of the Bay and the SDIS proposed increased value of the marina docks from just under $500,000 to $1 million.  Cuellar provided the commissioners with emails from Nasburg Huggins, the Port’s insurance company, that reducing the value of the docks back to $500,000 would reduce the premium by $1,100.  Cuellar noted that the only thing that would presumably cause all of the docks to fail would be a flood and SDIS does not offer flood insurance for the docks.  If there was damage to part of the docks, given the condition of the current docks, it would be unlikely that damage would exceed $500,000.  She also explained that any damage to the docks could not be repaired this year because the Port could not get a permit to do repairs before the in-water work season begins.  At that time, the current docks will be removed for the new docks scheduled to go in. Pavlik asked if the $500,000 insurance would provide for loss of income if any of the docks had to be closed because of damage.  Cuellar said she would check with Nasburg Huggins.

The commissioners also looked at the difference in cost for the various deductibles under the plan.  The premium included a $250 deductible; Cuellar questioned whether the Port would actually file a claim if there was only $500 in damage, knowing the Port would only receive $250 and its future premiums could increase after filing a claim.  The commissioners chose to increase the deductible to $1,000, which would save $266.  

The proposed policy also included flood insurance for the Port buildings.  However, the deductible for the insurance was $500,000 per building.  Cuellar had discussed this with Nasburg Huggins, because the Port did not own any buildings that were valued at $500,000.  Nasburg Huggins agreed that flood insurance would not provide any benefits to the Port, so the commissioners agreed that flood insurance should be dropped.

Nasburg Huggins told Cuellar that they would check on Risk Insurance during the actual construction of the new boat launch and marina, since that would be when the new docks were most vulnerable to damage from floods and winds.

    B.  	Audit Recommendations

Tony Wilder, the Port’s auditor, provided a list of recommendations for the Port to implement to reduce the possibility of misappropriation of Port funds.  One recommendation was that the Port print checks using QuickBooks.  Wilder also recommended having the utility bills automatically paid to the Port’s credit card.  This was something the commissioners had already discussed and Cuellar told the commissioners that this was almost completed.  Wilder also recommended that the Board approve all invoices before they were paid.  Cuellar had told Wilder she had a problem with that recommendation.  Because the Board only met once a month, an invoice that arrived after a board meeting may have to wait for as many as five weeks for the board to approve payment.  By the time the payment was actually made and received, the invoice would be seriously late.  Cuellar suggested that one of the commissioners approve the invoices for any evidence of misappropriation, and the approved invoices would be printed and signed by Cuellar and the commissioners.  Wilder agreed that would be an acceptable solution to avoid late payments.

    C.   	New Bank Account for Bond Funds

Wilder had also recommended that a separate bank account be set up for the bond funds so that the bond funds could be reconciled separately from the general fund to reduce the possibility of errors being unrecognized.  

    D.   	Adoption of Resolution for New Bank Account

Pankey moved that the Board adopt Resolution 20-01-16 authorizing Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager, to open a second account at Columbia Bank for the bond funds.  Rohleder seconded the motion and the motion passed 5-0.

    E.   	Friends of the Port

Cuellar told the commissioners that she had run into Brian Fodness and asked him if he was still interested in creating a non-profit group similar to the Friends of the Library to help raise money for Port projects.  Fodness said he definitely was and would get back to Cuellar after she returned from vacation.

    F.   	Eckman Lake

Cuellar told the commissioners that Paul Engelmeyer, President of the Central Coast Watershed Council, had contacted her because the Watershed Council would like to talk with the Port about working on a solution to the algae problem at Eckman Lake.  One of the officers of the Watershed Council lives on Eckman Lake.  Cuellar suggested that she, Rohleder, and Pankey meet with the Watershed Council group first rather than have them meet the first time with the full board since the board had not yet given Cuellar any instructions on Eckman Lake. 



    IX. COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Rohleder provided a legislative report on the Oregon Legislature Short Session.  He said there would be a bill to help fund failing septic tanks, which is probably one of the issues exacerbating the algae at Eckman Lake.  There will be a bill for carbon sequestering, but rural areas would be exempt for five years.  He also noted that beavers could be declassified as predators.

Power told the commissioners that she and Phi were still working on the Port’s website.  A summer break had allowed Phi time to tweak the software.  The website needs pictures and she asked the commissioners if they could contribute some.

Pavlik said the new docks fabricated by Bergerson were nice.  He suggested that the outside of the new A Dock could be used for sailboat tie-ups when the new marina is completed.

Bishop suggested that perhaps the Port should be looking at having a safety inspection for the Port facilities.  OSHA did an inspection at the Port’s request about 18 months ago for the shop, but it would probably be a good thing to have safety procedures in writing.  Cuellar said that the Port should restart having the required OSHA monthly safety meetings.  The Port had held those monthly when Joe Warren was the maintenance person but the Port had stopped having them when Robby had begun to do maintenance and was the only maintenance person. Cuellar said she would get them started again.

X. 	ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:15.
