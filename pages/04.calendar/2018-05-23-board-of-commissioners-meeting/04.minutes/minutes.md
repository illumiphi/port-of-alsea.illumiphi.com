# I. CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary Buster Pankey, Joe Rohleder, and Chuck Pavlik were present.  Pavlik arrived shortly after the meeting began.

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  David Ulbrecht, the Port’s Municipal Advisor, attended the meeting.  Dennis Anstine, reporter for the Newport News-Times also attended.

# II. APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the April 19, 2018 minutes and April, 2018 Financial Report.  Pankey seconded the motion.  The motion passed 4-0.

# III.  MEETING WITH DAVID ULBRECHT ON BOND SALES

Ulbrecht answered questions from the commissioners and the port manager about the future sale of the G O Bonds after the passage of the bond measure on May 15, 2018.  He explained that the bond money did not need to be kept in a separate bank account, but could be provided separate line items in the general fund. It would also be set up as a different class in QuickBooks.  He explained the difference between a private sale and a public sale.  The public market is most usual and the bonds are sold to bond measure companies, money market funds, etc.

He will prepare the Request for Proposal (RFP) to the bond underwriters.  The RFP would be sent out in mid-June, 2018.  Needed selections would be made around July 1, with the bonds sold and the money dispersed about mid-August.

The Port would sign an annual disclosure agreement.  He will provide a template.

Rohleder was unable to attend the work session and regular meeting scheduled on Thursday, June 21, but he was hoping to attend the work session.  The commissioners decided by consensus to hold the work session on Tuesday, July 19, at 10:00.

# IX.	COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Rohleder noted that the Shrimp Daddy was getting bait shrimp farther up the river than he had seen them before.  He wondered whether they were being over-harvested.

# X. 	ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:10.
