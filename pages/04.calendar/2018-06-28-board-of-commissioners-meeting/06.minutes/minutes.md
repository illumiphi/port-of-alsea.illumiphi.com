# CALL TO ORDER

Board President Bishop called the meeting to order at 2:00.

Commissioners Present:  President Rob Bishop, Vice-President Jan Power, Secretary Buster Pankey, and Chuck Pavlik were present.  Rohleder arrived shortly after the meeting began. 

Management and Staff:  Roxie Cuellar, Port Manager

Members of the Public and Media:	  Jon Holbrook, designer.  No other member of the public was present.  The media did not attend.

# APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR

Power moved to approve the Consent Calendar, specifically the May 23, 2018 minutes, the June 6, 2018 Special Meeting Minutes, and the May Financial Report.  Pavlik seconded the motion.  The motion passed 4-0.

# MEETING WITH JOHN HOLBROOK ON THE DESIGN OF THE MARINA

The commissioners discussed different design options with Holbrook.  Specifically, the commissioners, by consensus, instructed Holbrook to draft a marina design consistent with the proposal by Commissioner Pankey, which would have the outer dock (A Dock) as the longer dock, moving the gangway to the docks to the east end of B Dock, with the slips on A Dock measuring 20 feet in length and those on B Dock being 25 feet.  The double slips would have a width of 25 feet.  The west end of A Dock would have a dock, rather than a finger, perpendicular to the dock to act as a wave break.  Cuellar told Holbrook she would send him a digital copy of the Marine Board’s engineered boat launch and the initial permit that had been submitted to the Corps and DSL.

# ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS

Ann Sherman, the Port’s bond attorney, had sent a resolution for the commissioners to consider for the adoption for the sale and issuance of the bonds.  Specifically, the commissioners considered Resolution 18-6-28, A Resolution of the Port of Alsea, Lincoln County, Oregon Authorizing the Issuance, Sale and Delivery of General Obligation Bonds: Designating an Authorized Representative; Delegating the Negotiation and Approval of Financial Documents and Related Matters.  After the commissioners reviewed the proposed resolution, Powers moved to adopt the resolution and Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 5-0.

# PUBLIC COMMENT

There was no public comment.

# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar told the commissioners that she was meeting with Ellie Donavan to select a site for her to erect the memorial bench for her husband that the Board had approved at its March meeting.  She also approved Nick Rust, maintenance to install an irrigation system in the lawn at the office for watering.  It would not be on timers and the cost of the materials was less than $150.00.  She discussed the need to get more lighting on the docks, especially for the new marina.  There had already been a jump in reported thefts of crab pots from the docks at night.  She also purchased a new, used refrigerator because the compressor went out in the old one.  Cuellar, Bishop, and Pankey had a meeting with the Oregon State Marine Board staff the following week to discuss the construction of the new boat launch and marina.  She ordered signs for the exterior of the doors; one would say Port of Alsea Office and the other would say Port of Alsea Board Room.  That would permit the closure of the office, while keeping the board room open for meetings.  She was going to order new hats for sale, because the supply had become very low.  Pavlik suggested camouflage.  Cuellar said she would check into that. Cuellar told the commissioners that the moorage reservations are already starting to fill up for September.

# OLD BUSINESS

## Appointments to the Citizen Review Committee

Cuellar recommended that the commissioners establish criteria to be used to choose the three at-large- places on the Citizen Review Committee to review the financial transactions pertaining to the bond measure.  She noted that all of the budget committee who would serve on the Citizen Review Committee were from Waldport and that the commissioners, for example, could use geographical diversity as one criteria.  The commissioners decided to use that criteria and previous services to the Port as an additional criteria.  The applicants considered by the commissioners were:

1.	Mark St. John, Alsea
2.	John C. Perez, Waldport
3.	Alanna Miklie, Waldport
4.	Dann Cutter, Waldport
5.	Quinton Smith. Yachats
6.	Brian Fodness, Waldport
7. 	Joan Davies, Yachats

The commissioners selected Mark St. John, Alsea, who resides east on the Alsea River, just within the Port District, Quinton Smith, Yachats, and Brian Fodness, Waldport.

## Food Carts

Cuellar told the commissioners that Troy Smith had opened his food cart.  It is called the Alsea Bay Crab Company.  He offers several kinds of seafood or sandwiches, and also has a small deli of fresh seafood.

## Review of Findings for Design – Build Bids

Adam Springer, the Port’s attorney for the bid and permit process on the construction of the boat launch and marina, had submitted a draft Findings of Fact for the Board to review.  The board will hold a public hearing at its July 26 meeting to decide whether to adopt an Exemption from Competitive Bidding Requirements as the basis for the Request for Proposals (RFP) on the marina and boat launch construction.  Adam Springer and Bud Shoemake, manager at the Port of Toledo, had met with the commissioners at a work session on May 23, 2018, to discuss the various bid options available to the Board.  The commissioners at that meeting had opted for the design / build option.  The commissioners discussed the draft findings, but not action was taken.



# NEW BUSINESS

## Scarborough / Betts Proposal

Sharon Scarborough addressed the commissioners pertaining to a request by Ron Betts and herself to acquire two parcels of property owned by the Port on the north side of the Alsea Bay.  Cuellar has suggested that they submit their request in writing to the board prior to the meeting.  In the letter, they “seek to acquire two properties owned by the Port of Alsea…”, specifically lots 601 and 602 on the plat maps provided. It was their understanding that the easements on the lots had expired.  Cuellar told the board she had done some research on the parcels.  One of them, lot 601, provides the only access to a lot owned by Daniel O’Malley.  She had spoken with O’Malley, who told her that the easement through the Port’s property is, in essence, his driveway.  Lot 602 appears to provide the only access to Sandra Halsey’s property.  O’Malley told Cuellar that he was meeting with an attorney because of several attempts by Scarborough and Betts to seize parts of his property.  Cuellar strongly advised the commissioners not to consider selling the lots to Scarborough and Betts for several reasons, including potential liability for the Port.  Bishop said that he had not heard of easements on land expiring.  Scarborough said that she and Betts did not really need to acquire the property, if they could simply manage the property.  She said there was some trees on the property that posed a danger to their house.  The commissioners decided that Cuellar, Pavlik, and Bishop would go out to the property at a later date and if there were trees that posed a hazard, arrange to have them removed. 

## Website

Power discussed the changes that were being made to update the Port’s website, which she had agreed to manage once the changes were made.

## Second Annual Newsletter

Cuellar reminded the Board that the second annual newsletter was due to go out to the Port residents in September.  She noted that it was an excellent time to bring residents up to date on the progress pertaining to the bond measure.

# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Rohleder told the commissioners that he had been investigating possible places where the Port could construct a kayak launch on the Yachats River, at Cuellar’s request.  He planned to check with timber companies and BLM / Forest Service to see identify landowners on the Yachats River that could provide an easement for the public to access the launch.  The Port would assume responsibility for the launch, but not the maintenance of the access.  He also contacted ODF&W and asked if someone from ODF&W would come and speak to the Board about the biology of the sand shrimp and the allocation of licenses for their harvest.  Rohleder and others had expressed concerns that the bait shrimpers were depleting the resources in the bay.  Rohleder said he would arrange the meeting when things slowed down a bit.

Pavlik noted that ODF&W had reduced the halibut quotas compared to last year’s quota.  He wondered if it was perhaps because the full quota was not taken last year.  Rohleder said he thought it had more to do with biological issues.

Pavlik raised the issue ecological damage to Eckman Lake and, as the owner of Eckman Lake, what the Port should do about it.  Commissioners said the problem is that there is not enough water in Eckman Creek to flush out the lake, which creates an algae problem in the summer.  Rohleder said he could put together an abstract on the issue.  He said perhaps the Alsea Sportman’s Association could take the lead.  Power suggested the Alsea Watershed Council.  Cuellar said she was a strong advocate of the Port taking care of its property, but asked the commissioners how the Port should deal with the problem.  Pavlik said he would talk with the people at the Baptist Church on the lake to see if he could get a room to discuss the future of Eckman Lake.  Bishop said that part of the problem could be that all of the homes around the lake are on septic systems.  Pankey said that M & E has a permit to ground filter biosolids above the lake.  He said people used to water ski on the lake.  Pavlik noted that the City of Waldport gets its water from Eckman Creek, which reduces the flow of water into the lake in the summer months.  He would try to set up a meeting for August 10 for the Alsea Sportman’s Association to have a meeting about Eckman Lake.

# ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:25.
