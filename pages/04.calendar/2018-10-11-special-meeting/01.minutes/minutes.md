# EXECUTIVE SESSION

# SPECIAL SESSION

## Selection of Contractors for Interviews for the Marina Project

After reviewing the five contractor proposals for the construction of the proposed boat launch and marina in Executive Session, Attorney Adam Springer led the discussion of the allocation of points for each contractor on the components of the Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The components were:

1.	Recent Experience
2.	Similar Project History
3.	Firm Experience / Design Experience
4.	Staffing and Staff Qualifications
5.	Project Approach
6.	Fees

Springer began by recommending that the commissioners reject the proposal of Pacific Pile and Marine as being untimely and non-responsive because part of the proposal came in 15 minutes past the 2:00 deadline and because the fee schedule was completed incorrectly, making it impossible to compare the proposed fees with the other proposals.  Springer then recommended that the commissioners come to a consensus for the points given to each remaining contractor for each component of the RFP.  He suggested that for the category “Recent Experience” that each contractor be give a pass or fail, rather than a number.  All of the contractors received a pass.

The numbers assigned to the contractors, in each of the categories, were as follows, in the order described above:

|Legacy Contracting, In.        | 10|	5 | 13| 18| 17|Total 	63
|Advanced American Construction |17 12	13	  7	  7		Total	56
|Triton Marine Construction		|20	15	13	23	  5		Total	76
|Bergerson Construction		|25	|12	13	25	20		Total	95

The commissioners and Springer discussed, given the difference by which Bergerson outscored the other contractors, if it was necessary to hold interviews that were scheduled on the 16th.  Cuellar suggested that interviewing Bergerson would give the commissioners the opportunity to ask Greg Morrill some of the questions and concerns that the commissioners had already expressed about the project in previous meetings.  Springer told the commissioners that since the RFP schedule said there would be interviews that it would be best to interview Bergerson.  Springer told Cuellar that he would send her a letter in the morning of the Notice to Tentatively Award the contractor to put on the Port’s letterhead and to send out to all of the companies that submitted proposals.  They would then have ten days to file an objection to the award.

Cuellar recommended to the commissioners that instead of interviewing Bergerson on October 16th and returning on the 17th for their regular board meeting, that they interview Bergerson at their October 17th regular meeting.  The commissioner agreed to do that.

## Investment of the Bond Proceeds

The commissioners resumed the discussion about the investment of the bond proceeds that they had begun at their September 20, 2018 regular meeting.  They had the materials produced by the Oregon Local Government Investment Fund.  Cuellar told them that their municipal advisor, David Ulbricht, had recommended the fund, as had one of the Port’s budget committee members, Kevin Battles.  She told the commissioners that the advantages of the LGIP was that the funds were liquid, so they would be available as the Port needed them to pay for the construction work.  She told them the current interest rate was 2.5%.  However, she reminded them that the LGIP was a low-risk, not a no-risk fund and that the principal was not guaranteed.  She told the commissioners that most of the money would be expended within two years, so the risk was relatively short-term, but it still existed.

Pavlik expressed concern about taking any risk with the bond funds at all.  Cuellar was asked what other options the Port had to invest the money.  She told the commissioners that no-risk options included money market accounts, CDs, and treasury bills.  However, the interest rates of the CDs and T-Bills were contingent upon the maturity dates.  The short-term maturity rates would provide more liquidity when the funds were needed, but also paid lower interest rates.  The Port’s current bank account is categorized as a public interest account and already pays more than a money market account.

Power moved that the Port put all of the bond funds except $65,000 into the LGIP.  Rohleder seconded the motion.  The motion passed 5-0. 

# ADJOURNMENT

As there was no further business, Bishop adjourned the meeting at 4:05.
