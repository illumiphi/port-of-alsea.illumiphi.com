# MANAGER’S REPORT

Cuellar told the commissioners that Tony Wilder would be at the Port office the first week of October to begin the Port’s annual audit.  She also told the board that the boat launch will close on October 21 to begin the construction process.  She told the commissioners that she was meeting with Gary Woodson, Central Coast Fire and Rescue Chief at 1:00, on September 24, 2020, at the Port office.  She asked if two commissioners wanted to attend as well.  Power volunteered to participate.  Cuellar told the commissioners that there were times occasionally when she paid out money to Port guests out of petty cash.  A typical situation would be when someone who made a moorage reservation for a few days paid in cash and then canceled the reservation.  Most moorage reservations are over the phone and people pay with credit cards.  Under those circumstances, the refund can be given through Square back to their credit cards.  However, in the case of locals, they may stop by the office to receive their refund and that she would take that money out of petty cash.  She suggested that she have a cap of $100 out of petty cash that could be used for those circumstances.  Cuellar said that was enough, that the Port did not deal much in cash any more. The exception was the cash that people put into the launch pay station, but that is only $7.00 and refunding a launch ticket is very rare.  About the only time it happens is when people do not see the ticket that drops into the bin and pay a second time, but that happens rarely.  Almost all outgoing transactions are with either the Port credit card or by check.

# PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD

No members of the public or the media attended the meeting.

## Marine Board Grants

Cuellar reported to the commissioners that the Oregon State Marine Board had approved both of the grants that the Port of Alsea had applied for.  The first was a Waterway Access Grant to help finance the construction of the kayak launch; that grant was approved for $28,000.  The second grant was a Boating Facilities Grant to help pave the gravel portion of the west parking lot that serves the boat launch.  That grant was for $39,750.

## Boat Launch and Marina Construction

Cuellar confirmed to the commissioners that Bergerson said the October 21, 2020 closure date for the boat launch sounded right. He plans to have a detailed schedule in the next two to three weeks.  Cuellar told the commissioners that Robby Hensen, maintenance, is assessing what the Port will need to do when it is time to close the facilities.

	
# EXECUTIVE SESSION

The board went into executive session to discuss property negotiations.


# COMMISSIONERS’ COMMENTS

Commissioner Rohleder told the board that the wildfires in Oregon had impacted several of the hatcheries in the state, with a big impact at Rock Creek and on the Umpqua.  They are rebuilding the hatcheries but the loss of the hatchery fish will have a large impact on future ocean fishing for salmon off the central Oregon coast.

Commissioner Pavlik said that the incubator boxes have been installed on a creek that empties into the Alsea River near the research hatchery.  The salmon eggs will be put into the incubator boxes this winter, and about 30,000 Chinook fry will go down the Alsea next spring.  Those that survive will be part of a future fall run.

# THE MEETING WAS ADJOURNED AT 3:40.
